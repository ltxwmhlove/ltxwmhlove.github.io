I don't know how to describe the hardness I've been through to here.

Just So So So Hard.

I remerbered, for one week, I slept after 3:00am. Just want to solve one problem.
I remerbered, for one week, as I walked on the road, I was always thinking about the command line.

But, whatever, I am here now.

Hello, World!

And thank you for visiting.
